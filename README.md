# Roomify 🏠

Roomify is a modern frontend web application that helps freshers and job joiners
find compatible roommates in a new city.

The platform allows users to browse roommate listings, filter by preferences,
add their own listing, and directly contact potential roommates through a clean
and intuitive interface.
